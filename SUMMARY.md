# PDF Editor Web Application - Project Summary

## Overview

This project is a web-based PDF editor application that allows users to:
1. Upload PDF documents
2. Edit the content in a rich text editor (TinyMCE)
3. Export the edited content back to PDF format while preserving formatting

## Architecture

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

- **Server**: Express.js server handling API requests
- **PDF Processing**: 
  - PDF-to-HTML conversion (placeholder in current implementation)
  - HTML-to-PDF conversion using Puppeteer
  - PDF metadata extraction using pdf-lib
- **File Handling**: Multer for file uploads

### Frontend (React)

- **Main Components**:
  - PDFUploader: For uploading PDF files
  - PDFEditor: TinyMCE integration for editing PDF content
  - Header/Footer: Navigation and layout components
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state management
- **API Integration**: Axios for API calls to the backend

## Features Implemented

- PDF file upload with drag-and-drop support
- Rich text editing with TinyMCE
- Side-by-side view of original PDF and editor
- Export to PDF functionality
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## Technical Implementation Details

### PDF Processing

The application uses a multi-step approach for PDF editing:

1. **Upload**: User uploads a PDF file
2. **Conversion**: The server extracts content (placeholder in current implementation)
3. **Editing**: User edits content in TinyMCE editor
4. **Export**: Edited content is converted back to PDF using Puppeteer

### Limitations

- The current implementation uses a placeholder for PDF content extraction
- Complex PDF layouts with images, tables, and special formatting may not be perfectly preserved

## Future Enhancements

- Implement robust PDF content extraction with better formatting preservation
- Add support for editing PDF forms
- Add collaborative editing features
- Implement PDF annotation tools
- Add direct integration with cloud storage services
